# EastAsiaClimateExtremes

Initiative for Developing an East Asia Climate Extremes Dataset!

This repository provides historical data on climate extremes across the East Asia(EA) region, basically archiving **the events of regular grid-based climate extremes**, and **weekly/monthly extremeness metrics** can be utilized as labels for AI-assisted models to predict anomalous climate events in East Asia. These efforts are part of the climate extreme prediction project led by the ART/APCC team (AI-based prediction Research and Technology at the APEC Climate Center). Currently, the repository focuses on extreme phenomena such as ***anomalously high temperatures(AHT)***, ***heavy rainfall(HR)***, and ***marine heatwaves(MHW)***, with the potential for further expansion. Additionally, it offers code for analyzing and visualizing key statistics and characteristics of atmospheric and oceanic extremes. We hope this page serves as a meaningful and practical starting point for researchers diving into studies on the dynamics and prediction of extreme phenomena.

# Overview: How certain is applied scaler and transformer? 
Development of post-correction skill to improve sub-seasonal to seasonal climate prediction of Korean Peninsula. 

The most common data preparation in machine learning is examining the expectations of a machine learning algorithm, and then carefully choosing the most appropriate data preparation technique to transform the raw data to best meet the expectations of the algorithm. This is expensive, slow, and requires a huge amount of expertise.



# Transformation
- Scalers and Transformers used



# Data Transformation Process based on Grid Search for S2S  
Grid search sequences of data preparation methods to further improve model performance.

Data preparation of transformation based on Grid search requires less expertise than the traditional manual approach to data preparation, although it is computationally costly. But, this method is also a method that can prepare data non-intuitively for developing a model with excellent or best performance without extensive knowledge of data preparation.
